      Insurance Premium Prediction ‚Äî A Clear Analysis
1. Random Forest: Predictions vs Reality

We compare the model‚Äôs predicted charges with the actual charges. Blue dots: Each represents a single insurance case. Red dashed line: Exact match between prediction and truth. Most dots sit close to the red line. For most people, the model gives a fair estimate. Charges rise as predictions rise. For low to middle charges (under $20,000), it‚Äôs usually spot on. For high charges (over $40,000), the gap between prediction and reality widens. The worst mistakes are for rare, costly cases such as long hospital stays or complex surgery ‚Äî the model tends to underestimate them. Error measure: The root mean squared error (RMSE) tells us how far predictions tend to be from reality. If RMSE is about $4,200, that‚Äôs the typical gap for an average case. For mid‚Äërange policies (about $10,000‚Äì$20,000), that gap can be 20‚Äì40% of the total ‚Äî not trivial. For public health forecasts or setting premiums, the model is good for broad trends but risky for individual extremes.
2. Correlation Heatmap

We measure how strongly age, body mass index (BMI), and the number of children relate to charges. Findings: Age and BMI both push costs up. The number of children makes very little difference. Meaning: Older and heavier customers tend to cost more. Children in the household are less relevant for an adult‚Äôs medical bill. Limits: Correlation is not cause. We don‚Äôt see hidden factors such as smoking or chronic illness in this measure.
3. Distribution of Charges

We plot every person‚Äôs charges to see the shape of the data. Costs are skewed: most are modest, but a few are very high. Those few expensive cases dominate the total bill. Implication: An insurer needs buffers, such as reinsurance, to cover these exceptional claims. In public health, it‚Äôs these high‚Äëneed patients who may benefit most from targeted care.
4. Charges by Smoking Status

A simple boxplot shows the point: Smokers pay much more, on average, and their costs vary more widely and run to higher extremes. Take‚Äëaway: Smoking remains a clear risk ‚Äî both medically and financially.
5. BMI and Charges, with Smoking

Plotting BMI on the x‚Äëaxis and charges on the y‚Äëaxis, and colouring points by smoking status, we see that higher BMI means higher charges on average, and smokers cost more than non‚Äësmokers at the same BMI. Conclusion: The two risks act together, not separately.
6. Median Charges by Region

Data split into four regions shows medians differ ‚Äî some regions are costlier than others. This could be due to local prices, population health, or care access. Implication: Region should be part of pricing and planning.
7. Feature Importance in the Model

The model ranks smoker status, age, and BMI as the most useful factors. Location and sex matter less. For both insurers and public health bodies, getting accurate data on the top factors is vital.
Common Weaknesses

The data comes from a single source and may not match real‚Äëworld insurer populations. Missing details ‚Äî diagnoses, previous care ‚Äî mean we rely on rougher proxies like age and BMI. The model struggles with rare, high‚Äëcost cases.

       This report examines 1,338 individual health insurance records to identify the strongest drivers of cost. The dataset includes age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and annual charges. The analysis focuses on mean costs, distribution patterns, and key contrasts between groups.
1. Data Snapshot

    Average age: 39 years (range: 18‚Äì64)

    Average BMI: 30.66 (in the obese range; range: 15.96‚Äì53.13)

    Average annual charge: $13,270 (range: $1,122‚Äì$63,770)

    Sex split: 50.5% male, 49.5% female

    Smoker prevalence: 20.5% yes, 79.5% no

    Regional distribution: Roughly even across four US regions, with the Southeast largest (27%).

2. Main Findings
2.1 Smoking is the Largest Cost Driver

Smokers pay on average nearly four times more than non-smokers.

    Smokers: mean $32,050

    Non-smokers: mean $8,440
    The gap is consistent across all age groups and BMI ranges, making smoking the clearest and most defensible pricing determinant.

2.2 Age Matters, but Predictably

Costs rise steadily with age, from an average of $8,400 in the 18‚Äì25 group to over $21,000 for those aged 56‚Äì65. This reflects natural increases in healthcare needs over the life cycle.
2.3 BMI Links to Cost, But with Caveats

Higher BMI correlates with higher average charges. People in the ‚ÄúObese II+‚Äù category (BMI ‚â• 35) pay about 50% more than those in the ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù range. However, the relationship is weaker than smoking or age, and there is substantial variation within each BMI category.
2.4 Minor Factors: Children, Gender, Region

    Children: Small, inconsistent effects on costs.

    Gender: Men pay slightly more than women on average.

    Region: The Southeast has the highest average costs; differences elsewhere are small.

3. Ethical Considerations

BMI is not a perfect measure of health. Overemphasis could unfairly penalize individuals, especially younger women, who may already face strong body image pressures. Tying pricing too closely to BMI risks fuelling disordered eating and weight stigma. Environmental and socioeconomic factors also affect BMI beyond personal control.
Smoking, by contrast, is a voluntary and well-proven risk factor with a direct causal link to higher medical costs. Highlighting smoking as the main determinant in pricing is both ethically and commercially sound. BMI can remain as one signal in a broader risk model, but not as a blunt pricing lever.
4. Recommendations

    Weight premiums heavily on smoking status and reward quitting through lower rates.

    Incorporate age in a predictable tiered structure to match rising health costs over time.

    Treat BMI cautiously, using it in combination with other health indicators.

    Offer health incentives ‚Äî cessation programs for smokers, lifestyle support for weight management ‚Äî as cost-control strategies.

    Review regional pricing for the Southeast and investigate underlying drivers.

5. Conclusion

The strongest and most actionable insight from this dataset is that smoking is the single biggest cost driver in individual health insurance, followed by age. BMI has a measurable effect but should be handled with care to avoid ethical and reputational risks. A pricing strategy anchored in these facts can be both fair and financially robust.
